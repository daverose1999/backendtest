Restful Api 
1. What is it?
Respresentational State Transfer
They are statless backends without the need for HTML trappings. 

Restful Constraints
1. client-server Architecture - should not concern with ui
2. statless - no session is stored
3. cacheability - responses must define as cacheable or non-cacheable (for efficiency)
4. layered system - ??? (further study)
5. uniform interface - responses are identify in requests and transferred data is decoupled from db schema
??? (further study)
6. code on demand (optional) - ???
